## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- (Optional) A local HTTP server to serve files (for CORS / audio playback)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/kapilcyber/MusicVibesHub.git
   cd MusicVibesHub
'''

2. (Optional) Start a simple HTTP server. For example, using Python:

   '''bash
   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server 8000
   '''

   Or using Node’s `http-server`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server .
   ```

### Running Locally

* Open `index.html` in your browser (or visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` if using a local server)
* Navigate to `login.html` for the login page
* Click on a track from the playlist, and press play

---

## Usage

1. Go to **Login Page** (`login.html`).
2. Enter credentials (this is mock / front-end only—no real back-end validation).
3. After “logging in”, you’ll be taken to the main page with the track list.
4. Click on any track to play it. Use built-in controls (play, pause, skip) as supported.
5. The UI layout is responsive / basic, but you can enhance it further.

If you like, I can also generate a **README** with badges, live demo links, or GitHub Actions. Do you want me to create a more advanced one (with deploy, CI, etc.) for your repo?
